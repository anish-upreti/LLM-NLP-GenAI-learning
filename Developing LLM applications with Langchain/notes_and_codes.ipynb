    "## Langchain Overview\n",
    "LangChain is a powerful open-source framework designed to help developers build applications powered by large language models (LLMs). It provides a standardized interface and modular components to make it easier to integrate LLMs like OpenAI's GPT models with external tools, data sources, and custom logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîç What Is LangChain?\n",
    "At its core, LangChain helps you build ‚Äúlanguage model + logic + data‚Äù apps. Instead of treating the LLM as a standalone black box, LangChain allows you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain together multiple LLM calls\n",
    "\n",
    "Connect LLMs to external data sources (like databases, APIs, files)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use memory to maintain state across interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "Interact with agents that can make decisions based on context\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß± Key Components\n",
    "#### 1. LLM Wrappers\n",
    "LangChain supports integration with many LLM providers:\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI (GPT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Anthropic (Claude)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cohere\n",
    "\n",
    "Hugging Face\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Vertex AI\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Chains\n",
    "Chains are sequences of calls (to LLMs, tools, or logic) that solve a task. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "SimpleChain: A single LLM prompt-response.\n",
    "\n",
    "SequentialChain: Multiple steps where output of one is input to the next.\n",
    "\n",
    "CustomChain: Combine logic, tools, and multiple models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Memory\n",
    "Maintains state between chain runs, essential for:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chatbots that remember the conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents that build up context over time\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Agents\n",
    "Agents use LLMs to make decisions about which tools or actions to use:\n",
    "\n",
    "Choose tools dynamically based on user input\n",
    "\n",
    "Loop through tool use and reasoning\n",
    "Example: An agent that answers questions using a search API and calculator tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Tools\n",
    "External utilities the LLM can use via agents:\n",
    "\n",
    "Web search\n",
    "\n",
    "Database lookup\n",
    "\n",
    "Python execution\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Retrieval and Vector Stores\n",
    "LangChain integrates with vector databases for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG):\n",
    "\n",
    "Pinecone, Weaviate, Chroma, FAISS, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allows querying large text/document datasets using semantic search\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Common Use Cases\n",
    "Chatbots with memory and context\n",
    "\n",
    "Document Q&A over PDFs or knowledge bases\n",
    "\n",
    "Autonomous agents for data gathering or task automation\n",
    "\n",
    "Data analysis and summarization pipelines\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom workflow automation with LLM logic\n",
    "\n",
    "### üåê Ecosystem & Integrations\n",
    "LangChain is built to integrate with:\n",
    "\n",
    "Vector stores (Pinecone, FAISS, Chroma)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cloud storage (AWS, GCP, Azure)\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs and tools\n",
    "\n",
    "UI frameworks like Streamlit, Gradio"
